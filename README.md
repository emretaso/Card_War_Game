## Card War

War uses a standard 52-card deck. Shuffle the cards sufficiently before playing, especially if the deck is brand new. Either player can be the dealer or a third person. Deal cards back and forth so that each player has 26 cards. Do not look at your cards.

To play, count down from 3 and flip cards at the same time so that they are face up. Only flip the top card, no peaking! Other cards must remain secret. The player with the higher card wins and collects both cards, return cards to the bottom of their personal deck. If players flip the same card, the war begins.

###The War
During a war, each player places three more cards, face-down, on the game playing surface. After, flip over a fourth card so that it is face up. Whoeverâ€™s card is the highest is the winner, they collect all 10 cards and the next round begins. If the fourth cards are also the same, repeat the previous instructions until there is a winner.

If a player does not have enough cards for the war they must place their last card face-up.
